This model assumes as panmictic population, so think of this estimates as the size of the ancestry pool at the time depth of the co-ancestry of the ROH you are fitting. The model used is described in the Supplement of https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.01.126730 and using the same framework introduced in https://www.genetics.org/content/205/3/1335\n",
