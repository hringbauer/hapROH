This dataset includes ancient genotype data as described in Harney et al. (2018) in PACKEDANCESTRYMAP format.

You may convert the data to other formats using the "convertf" utility of EIGENSOFT (https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/EIGENSOFT/).

A number of different analyses can be performed using the appliations in ADMIXTOOLS (https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools).

The dataset includes three files: *.geno (genotype data), *.ind (individual data), and *.snp (SNP data). Together they contain genotype information for 22 ancient individuals from Peqi'in Cave, Israel.  The suffix "_d" refers to damage restriction which was performed to reduce potential contamination. See Supplementary Table 1 for background information about each sample
