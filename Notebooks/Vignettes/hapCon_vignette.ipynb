    "# Estimating Contamination Rate with hapCON for Male aDNA Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from version 0.4a1, hapROH package now has an extension called hapCON to estimate contamination for male aDNA samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This small notebook walks you through how to use hapCON to run estimate contamination in your male aDNA sample. We will use one 1240k sample SUA001, from Sardinia, and a WGS sample DA43, from Mongolia, XiongNu to illustrate hapCON's usage on two different reference panels. In this tutorial, both samples have been downsampled to 0.1x to keep runtime minimal.\n",

    "You can download the two BAM files at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tgvwq75mvixeyic/AAAGURMdDGWLIxGzwAgtGm1Sa?dl=0\n",

    "You can download the reference panel, the bed file used by samtools to get readcounts, and the metadata for reference panel at https://www.dropbox.com/s/1vv8mz9athedpiq/data.zip?dl=0\n"

    "You can run hapCON either from samtools's mpileup file or directly from BAM file. Running hapCON with BAM file is slower. We will first see how to run hapCON from samtools's mpileup file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the mpileup file for SUA001, we need a bed file to specify regions of interest, which is in the dropbox link provided above. Our bed file assumes that the contig name in your BAM file doesn't have chr or Chr prefix. If that is the case for your BAM file, please reset the header of your BAM file by \"samtools reheader -c 'perl -pe \"s/^(@SQ.*)(\\tSN:)chr/\\$1\\$2/\"' in.bam > out.bam\". If you are unsure about the contig name of your BAM file, you can check it by \"samtools view -H in.bam\".\n",

    "We have assumed that you have put the BAM file at ./Data, and please change the path to bed file for 1240k panel according to your setup. After that, we can run the following to generate the mpileup file,\n"
