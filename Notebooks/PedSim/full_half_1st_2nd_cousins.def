# FIRST AND SECOND COUSINS
#
# generates one simulated pedigree with four generations
# in generation 2, there are two branches that contain one individual each that
# are full siblings of each other.
# these two full siblings each have a pair of offspring that form four branches
# in generation 3.
# in generation 4, the four branches each produce one child and these children
# get printed.
# Thus, since there are four branches in generation three, two sets of which are
# full siblings of each other, the final generation has two pairs of first
# cousins with all other pairwise relationships being second cousins.

# HALF FIRST AND SECOND COUSINS
#
# pedigree with the same structure as that given above except that the two
# children in generation 2 are half-siblings. To obtain half-siblings, the
# branch specification lists 1:1 and 2:1: individual b1-i1 from the first
# generation is the parent of both branches 1 and 2 in generation 2, but with
# different spouses (with ids b1-s1 and b1-s2).
# This results in half-first cousins and half-second cousins in the fourth
# generation.
